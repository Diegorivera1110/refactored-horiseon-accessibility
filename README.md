# Code Refactor Starter Code
Title: Code refactor project for Horiseon landing site

In this refactor I was altered almost every div to a semantic HTML element applying section and article.
After applying semantic HTML I moved on to swap out the divs from CSS to the semantic HTML tags to keep the flow of the page as intended in the mock-up.
