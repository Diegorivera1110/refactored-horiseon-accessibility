# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Summary:

In this refactor I altered almost every div in to a semantic HTML element applying section and article allowing screen readers to provide more detail the sections being read out loud.
After applying semantic HTML I moved on to swap out the 'divs' from CSS to the semantic HTML tags to keep the flow of the page as intended in the mock-up.
I also was able to take out multiple repetitive CSS rules and condense them with the site still looking like the mock-up.

## Languages Used:
* HTML
* CSS
